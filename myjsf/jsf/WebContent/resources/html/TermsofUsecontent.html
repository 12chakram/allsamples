 in restricting access to content. For example, once UltraViolet content is downloaded to an authorized Ultraviolet-compatible playback device, media player or software (each an “<b>UltraViolet Device</b>”) or streamed via a streaming service that does not
 require a Member login, such UltraViolet content may be accessible to anyone who has access to that UltraViolet Device or streaming service. In such circumstances, to the extent available, you must also set the parental controls on that UltraViolet Device
 or associated with such streaming service to restrict access to UltraViolet content.
</span><span lang="EN-US">It is your responsibility to research and properly configure the parental control settings on your UltraViolet Devices and streaming services to prevent access to inappropriate materials. If an UltraViolet Device or streaming service

 in your UltraViolet Account</span><span lang="EN-US">. UltraViolet allows you and other Members in your Account to register up to twelve different UltraViolet Devices to your UltraViolet Account. A particular UltraViolet Device may only be registered to one
 UltraViolet Account at any given time. Once an UltraViolet Device has been registered with your UltraViolet Account, you and other Members may use that UltraViolet Device to play downloaded UltraViolet content.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:7.5pt; text-align:justify; line-height:12.0pt; background:white">
<span lang="EN-US">In order to qualify as an UltraViolet Device, the device, media player, app, or other hardware or software product must display the UltraViolet logo (the logo may appear on packaging, manuals, inserts, load screens, etc., as opposed to the
 external casing of the device itself) and meet the system and compatibility requirements that DECE establishes from time to time. We may change the requirements for UltraViolet Devices from time to time and, in some cases, whether an UltraViolet Device remains
 a supported device may depend on software or systems provided or maintained by the device manufacturer or other third parties. As a result, devices that are UltraViolet Devices may cease to be supported in the future. Device manufacturers are responsible for
 ensuring that their UltraViolet Devices are compatible with UltraViolet. DECE makes no representation or warranty with respect to the compatibility of particular UltraViolet Devices.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:7.5pt; text-align:justify; line-height:12.0pt; background:white">
<span lang="EN-US">An UltraViolet Device may be removed from your UltraViolet Account. In order to perform a removal of an UltraViolet Device, you will need to follow the procedures specified by DECE. For the removal of an UltraViolet Device to be considered
 a “<b>Verified Removal</b>”, the UltraViolet Device itself must be involved in the removal process and you will likely need to follow a procedure that is prompted by such UltraViolet Device. In the event that you are unable to perform a Verified Removal (because
 of loss, damage, or any another reason), you may remove an UltraViolet Device by accessing your UltraViolet Account and initiating a removal; however, any such removal will be considered an “<b>Unverified Removal</b>”. In order to prevent the misuse of UltraViolet,
 DECE imposes limits on the number of times UltraViolet Devices can be removed and reregistered. Each UltraViolet Account is limited to two Unverified Removals every 365 days; additional attempted Unverified Removals within that period will not be considered
 a removal and will count against the UltraViolet Account’s limit of twelve UltraViolet Devices. An Unverified Removal may be converted into a Verified Removal in the event that a Verified Removal is subsequently initiated from the applicable UltraViolet Device.
 An UltraViolet Device that has been removed from an UltraViolet Account may only be re-registered to that same UltraViolet Account three times during any ninety-day period.</span></p>

 authorized streaming services you elect to use in connection with your UltraViolet Account. Depending on the type of streaming service you and the other Members of your UltraViolet Account elect to connect to, such streaming service may be available for use
 by all Members of your UltraViolet Account and without the need to separately log into your UltraViolet Account, or the streaming service may only be available to a particular Member after that Member logs in to his or her UltraViolet Account. Each streaming

<span lang="EN-US">Use of UltraViolet requires Internet access and at least one UltraViolet Device or device supported by a Streaming Service, and may require certain software and the obtaining of updates or upgrades thereto from time to time. You are responsible
 for any fees associated therewith. Because use of UltraViolet involves hardware, software, and Internet access, your ability to use UltraViolet may be affected by the performance of these factors as well as by changes in these technologies over time. High-speed
 Internet access is strongly recommended. In addition, all UltraViolet Devices may not support all of the features and functionality available for UltraViolet. For example, to view high definition UltraViolet content you will need a high-definition compatible
 UltraViolet Device. You acknowledge and agree that such system requirements, which may be revised from time to time, are your responsibility. You further acknowledge and agree that DECE is not responsible for failure in proper configuration or limitations
 of your UltraViolet Devices. UltraViolet is independent of such other products, services and offerings, and the purchase or obtaining of any such product, service or offering does not guarantee your access to the full features and functionality of UltraViolet.

 initial filing fee and you prevail, we will reimburse you for that fee. If there is a hearing, we will pay any fees of the arbitrator and arbitration firm for the first day of that hearing. All other fees will be allocated as provided by the rules of the arbitration
 firm and applicable law. In no event will you be required to reimburse us for any arbitration filing, administrative, or hearing fees in an amount greater than what your court costs would have been if the Claim had been resolved in a state court with jurisdiction.
 However, we will advance or reimburse your fee if the arbitration firm or arbitrator determines there is good reason requiring us to do so, or if you ask us and we determine there is good reason for doing so. Each party will bear the expense of that party’s
 attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.

<span lang="EN-US">5. <b>Class Actions and Severability</b>: </span><span lang="EN-US">If either party elects to resolve a claim by arbitration, that Claim shall be arbitrated on an individual basis. There shall be no right or authority for any claims to be
 arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other subscribers, or other persons similarly situated. No Claim submitted to arbitration is heard by a jury or
 may be brought as a private attorney general. You do not have the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any Claim submitted to arbitration (“<b>Class Action Waiver</b><b>”</b>). The parties
 to the Ultraviolet Terms of Use acknowledge that the Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the Ultraviolet Terms of Use to arbitrate Claims. 'Claim' does not include any
 challenge to the validity and effect of the Class Action Waiver, which must be decided by a court. The parties acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated. If any portion of this arbitration agreement or the Class Action
 Waiver is limited, voided or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding, subject to the right to appeal the limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver,
 that portion will be severed, and the rest of the arbitration agreement will continue to apply. If this entire agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void, then the parties agree that any Actions shall be commenced and heard in the appropriate court in New
 Castle County, Delaware. You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within New Castle County in the State of Delaware.</span></p>

 upon the arbitrator’s award. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any federal or state court with jurisdiction. The UltraViolet Terms of Use and the relationship between you and DECE shall be governed by the
 laws of the United States and the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
