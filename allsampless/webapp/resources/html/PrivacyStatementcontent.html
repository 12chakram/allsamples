            	<p>The UltraViolet service and the accompanying Web sites and user interfaces (collectively, "UltraViolet") are provided 	by Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem (DECE) LLC and its affiliates (collectively, "DECE").  UltraViolet provides a digital rights locker solution which gives registered members of an UltraViolet household  ("Household") one place to access to all of the UltraViolet-compliant digital content (the "Digital Content") purchased or rented by the Household.  UltraViolet also provides registered users of a Household account (each, a "Member") the right to manage access to the Digital Content in the Household account, and the right to register or update different UltraViolet-compliant devices for the playback of the Digital Content (each, a "Device").<br /><br />

This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") sets forth DECE's information collection, use and disclosure practices with regard to UltraViolet.  <br /><br />

By using UltraViolet, including purchasing or renting Digital Content through UltraViolet, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy as they may be amended from time to time.  In choosing to use UltraViolet, you therefore are consenting to DECE's collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information (as defined below) and UltraViolet Usage Information (including information about what Digital Content you purchase, rent or otherwise access through the Household account) as described in this Privacy Policy.<br /><br />

As UltraViolet is updated and expanded, this Privacy Policy may change, so please check back to review this page from time to time.  This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and part of, the UltraViolet Terms of Use [Embed hyperlink to Terms of Use of Web Site], which governs your use of UltraViolet in general.<br /><br />
					<b>
                    You may opt in or opt out of DECE's sharing of your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes by following the directions in the "Right to Opt In and Opt Out" [Embed hyperlink] section below.

					<br /><br />
Protecting the privacy of Personal Information is very important to DECE.  This Privacy Policy explains, in general, what Personal Information and other information is collected through UltraViolet, how the information is used, and with whom DECE may share such information.  "Personal Information" means information that may identify Members as individuals or allow online or offline contact with Members as individuals, including, for example, your name; display name; username; physical address; e-mail address; telephone number; photo or chosen image; age; date of birth, security questions and answers; parental controls; individual demographic information; Digital Content purchase or rental information, including, without limitation, title, artist, date of purchase, and place of purchase; information regarding your Digital Content streams and usage; the number of, and the makes and models of, the Devices you have added to the Household account; and the number of Members registered to the Household account and their Personal Information.
					<br /><br />
                    <b class="privacy_heading_1" id="Right_to_Opt">Right to Opt In and Opt Out</b>
                    <br /><br />
                    You may have the right to "opt in" to certain of DECE's uses and disclosures of your Personal Information.  For example, at the time you create the Household, and anytime thereafter by accessing the Household account, or through the Web site of a retailer providing UltraViolet-compliant Digital Content (a "Retailer"), you may have the opportunity to opt in to (1) allowing Retailers to access and display to you the Digital Content associated with the Household (including Digital Content that you obtained from another Retailer), (2) allowing Retailers to market to you based on the contents of the Household account, (3) receiving promotional offers from DECE, and (4) receiving third-party offers.  Once you opt-in, you will then have the right to change your mind and opt-out.    <br /><br />

Please understand that, even if you opt-out of receiving promotional correspondence from DECE, DECE and its authorized service providers may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with DECE and the Household account.  Also, if you wish to stop receiving promotional messages from third parties with whom DECE has already shared your contact information, you will need to contact them directly. <br /><br />

                    <b class="privacy_heading_1" id="What_Information">What Information is Collected through UltraViolet?</b><br /><br />
                    In order to make the most of your use of UltraViolet, DECE collects Personal Information about you, from you, your computer, and registered Devices.
                    <br /><br />

                            <br /><br />
                    		DECE collects Personal Information from Members of UltraViolet, for example, through Members' submission of registration information when they open new Households or add Members to existing Households, modify information in the Household accounts, request and receive customer service, and otherwise in the course of their use of UltraViolet.  Such information is also collected, for example, when a Member subscribes for features through UltraViolet, makes purchases of or rents Digital Content, completes surveys, submits a comment or question to DECE using a "contact us" or similar feature on the Web Site, sends DECE an e-mail, or in any other way submits Personal Information to DECE.  <br /><br />

You may be able to send information about UltraViolet to your friends and family members.  In some of these cases, you may provide the e-mail address of your friend or family member to DECE.  Such information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.  <br /><br />

                        DECE may use "cookies" to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.  Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server and stored on your computer or Device.  Cookies track your activities and preferences while using UltraViolet.  They may, for example, store your username and/or password.  A cookie may enable DECE to relate your use of UltraViolet to other information about you, including your Personal Information.  All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience using UltraViolet, including this Site.  <br /><br />

Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.  Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies.  However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, UltraViolet or certain areas or features of UltraViolet. <b class="font_size_14"> By using UltraViolet, you consent to DECE's use of cookies as described above. </b><br /><br />
						<b class="privacy_sub_heading_1">Clear GIFs
                        </b><br /><br />
                        DECE may use "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies to enable DECE to know whether you have visited a Web page, viewed content, or received a message.  A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of content or message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page, content or message.  A clear GIF may enable DECE to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page, content or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.

                        DECE's servers automatically collect data about your Internet address when you use UltraViolet.  This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer or Device by your Internet service provider or carrier whenever you're online.  DECE's servers may also record the Web page from which you linked to the Web Site (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on the Web Site; the Web site you visit after the Web Site; the ads you see and/or click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, Device, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on the Web Site or a referral site; and other usage activity and data logged by DECE's servers.  DECE uses this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with DECE's servers, and to administer UltraViolet.  Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet service provider or carrier.  DECE may also link this information with your Personal Information.  
<br /><br />
Any or all of these activities with regard to UltraViolet Usage Information may be performed on DECE's behalf by DECE's services providers.<br /><br />

                    UltraViolet is not directed to persons under 18 years of age at this time.  The UltraViolet services  are not currently designed to attract those under the age of 18 and we do not intentionally collect personal information from children on our site. <br /><br />

                    <br /><br />
                    DECE will use the Personal Information you provide through UltraViolet, and UltraViolet Usage Information, for example, to provide you with UltraViolet services, products and information, customer service, and otherwise to respond to your requests.  DECE may also use your Personal Information and UltraViolet Usage Information to maintain DECE's internal recordkeeping.  DECE may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and UltraViolet Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties.  
<br /><br />
In addition, DECE may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by DECE and others, that DECE think might interest you. You may opt out of receiving such notices from DECE by visiting the "Profile" area of the Household account. <br /><br />

DECE may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, UltraViolet, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate.

                            DECE works with partners to provide UltraViolet.  These partners include the publishers that create the Digital Content that is UltraViolet-compatible, the Retailers that sell or rent such Digital Content to UltraViolet Members, the service providers that host and/or stream the Digital Content for your use, the makers of the Devices that you use to access Digital Content through UltraViolet, and the service providers that implement and maintain UltraViolet (collectively, <b>"UltraViolet Partners"</b>).  In order to provide you with the UltraViolet service and its various features, DECE shares your Personal Information and UltraViolet Usage Information with UltraViolet Partners.  For example, DECE shares such information with Retailers so that Retailers can check whether you already have Digital Content in the Household that you are intending to purchase or rent again, make recommendations of Digital Content you may be interested in, and to enable you to add Devices to the Household through Retailers' Web sites.<br /><br />

                            DECE may use third-party service providers to help operate UltraViolet and deliver UltraViolet products, services or information, and may share your information with such service providers (such as Web site or customer service providers, database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, and other similar service providers that use such information on DECE's behalf). <br /><br />

                            When you contribute to a public area or feature of UltraViolet, such as a chat room, bulletin board, list serve, blog, wiki or other communication or community tool or area, the information that you submit or post will be made available to the general public, including other uses of UltraViolet.  For this reason, DECE recommends that you do not submit any sensitive information, including your full name, home address, phone number, other information that would enable other users to locate you, or financial information on these areas of the Web Site.  Instead, make up a username that does not disclose your personal identity.

                            DECE may disclose information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at DECE's discretion, or otherwise as required or permitted by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas.  DECE also may disclose information when DECE has reason to believe that someone is causing injury to or interference with DECE's rights or property, other users of UltraViolet, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.  <br /><br />

                     While DECE endeavors to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information collected via UltraViolet, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, DECE cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on DECE's system or otherwise in DECE's care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.  <br /><br />

If you contact DECE by e-mail or a "contact us" or similar feature on DECE's Web Site, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure while it is transmitted over the Internet.  A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit. 
<br /><br />
Once you establish a Household, you will be responsible for any access to or use of the Household account by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent.  You should, therefore, take all necessary precautions to ensure the confidentiality of your password.  Please notify DECE of any unauthorized use of your password or the Household account or any other breach of security relating to your Personal Information, this Site, or UltraViolet more generally. <br /><br />
In the unlikely event that DECE believes that the security of your Personal Information in DECE's possession or control may have been compromised, DECE may seek to notify you of that development.  If a notification is appropriate, DECE would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent DECE has your e-mail address, DECE may notify you by e-mail.  Absent your written instruction to the contrary, by using UltraViolet, you are<b> consenting to DECE's use of e-mail as a means of such notification.  If you wish to withhold such consent and request that DECE use the United States Postal Service to notify you in this situation, please e-mail DECE at [____________].    </b><br /><br />

                      When you are using UltraViolet, you may have the opportunity to visit, or link to, other Web sites, including other Web sites operated by unaffiliated third parties.  These sites may collect Personal Information about you.  DECE does not control sites that are operated by these entities and is not responsible for the information practices of these sites.

Whenever we amend the Privacy Policy, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the bottom of this page.  Continued use of UltraViolet following any changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of and consent to such changes.
