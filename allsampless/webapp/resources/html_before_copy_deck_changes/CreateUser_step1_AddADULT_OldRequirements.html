By accessing or using UltraViolet through our website (http://www.uvvu.com) (the "UltraViolet Website") or any third-party websites, you accept and agree to be bound by these UltraViolet Beta Terms of Use. The UltraViolet Beta Terms of Use is a legally binding agreement between you and DECE. If you do not wish to agree to these UltraViolet Beta Terms of Use, do not use UltraViolet. Changes to UltraViolet Beta Terms of Use DECE reserves the right, from time to time at any time and in its sole discretion, with or without additional notice to you, to change these UltraViolet Beta Terms of Use. You should review the UltraViolet Beta Terms of Use frequently to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of UltraViolet. The most current version of these terms can be viewed at any time by visiting the UltraViolet Website and clicking on "Terms of Use" at the bottom of the page. Such changes shall be effective upon the earlier of (i) your explicit acceptance of these updated terms via a "click-through" consent or other industry standard mechanism, or (ii) the date these new UltraViolet Beta Terms of Use are presented and available to you by posting on the UltraViolet Website. The most current version of the UltraViolet Beta Terms of Use will supersede all previous versions. If you do not agree to, or cannot comply with, the new Ultraviolet Beta Terms of Use, you must stop using UltraViolet and, cancel any existing UltraViolet accounts by navigating to the "Household Settings" link at the UltraViolet Website, and following instructions to delete individual accounts or the entire Household (defined below). Your continued use of UltraViolet, including the UltraViolet Website, after explicit acceptance of these terms or the posting of such changes constitutes acceptance of the changes. Jurisdictional Issues UltraViolet is intended for individuals who have created an account in the United States of America. DECE does not represent or warrant that services, UltraViolet Digital Content or other materials provided through UltraViolet are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Persons who choose to access UltraViolet from other locations do so on their own initiative, and are responsible for compliance with United States and local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. Households; Members; Parental Controls and Access Restrictions Setting up a Household In order to use UltraViolet, you must create a valid UltraViolet account to be used by members of your household (a "Household" or "Household Account"). You may create a Household Account through a participating retailer?website. In order to create a Household Account you must be at least eighteen (18) years old. By creating a Household Account, you represent that you have the right, authority and capacity to use UltraViolet and enter into a legally binding contract and that all age and other information provided in connection with the establishment of such Household Account is true and accurate. Setting up Members Each Household Account may have up to a total of six (6) authorized users including yourself (each a "Member"). Members can be added to a Household Account by registering such individual through the UltraViolet Website, participating third party retailer sites, or certain UltraViolet Devices. Once registered, each Member will have access to the UltraViolet Digital Content in the Household Account obtained by that Member, in addition to UltraViolet Digital Content obtained by the other Members of the Household. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrative and account management rights of any particular Member will depend on the access level granted to such Member. In addition, a Member?access to the UltraViolet Digital Content in the Household Account may be limited by the parental control settings established for such Member. Each Member of a Household will be assigned one of three access levels: a Basic Access Member, a Standard Access Member, or a Full Access Member. Your rights in connection with the Household will depend on your access level. As the first Member of a Household, the Household creator will be a Full Access Member. Subsequent Members of the Household may be assigned any of the three levels. Each access level has the ability to perform the functions set forth below: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | Basic Access | Standard Access | Full Access | |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |Access UltraViolet Digital Content | X | X | X | |in the Household | | | | |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |Associate/Disassociate a retailer Account | X | X | X | |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |Launch a Dynamic Streaming Service * | | X | X | |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |Add/remove Members | | X | X | |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |Set access levels of other Members | | | X | |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| |Set parental controls for other Members | | | X | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * As these terms are defined below Parental Controls You may wish to limit the types of UltraViolet Digital Content certain Members of your Household may access. UltraViolet is not intended for use by children without the involvement and supervision of a parent or legal guardian. Accordingly, UltraViolet offers parental controls designed to assist parents and legal guardians in preventing Members under eighteen (18) years old from obtaining and accessing certain UltraViolet Digital Content. You may take the following steps to restrict Member?obtaining and accessing certain UltraViolet Digital Content: 1. Set the parental controls within the Member?profile. Parental control settings are available within each Member?profile to prevent such Member from obtaining rights to or accessing certain restricted UltraViolet Digital Content. Once UltraViolet Digital Content is placed into a Household Account by any Member, all Members of the Household have access to it regardless of the age of the Member or the ratings for the content unless the parental control functionality is used. Each Full Access Member has the ability to set parental controls for other Members of a Household. However, please note that parental control settings may not apply to all services accessing your UltraViolet Household account. For example, a Linked Streaming Service provider will link to your Household at the Household level, rather than at the user level. In such cases, you should set appropriate access control settings for each service as applicable. 2. Set the parental controls available on the UltraViolet Devices accessible by the Member. Despite setting the parental controls offered within UltraViolet, once UltraViolet Digital Content is streamed or downloaded to an UltraViolet Device, it may be accessible to other users of that device unless the access control settings on such UltraViolet Device, if available, are also used. Therefore, you must configure your UltraViolet Devices to prevent access to these materials. 3. Maintain the integrity of your password and do not reveal it to any Member subject to parental control restrictions. Confidentiality and Passwords Maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Household Account is solely the responsibility of you and the other Members of your Household. Each Member of a Household will have his or her own password. Each Member is responsible for maintaining the security of his o her own password. To maintain the confidentiality and security of your Household Account, you should not reveal your password to anyone else and it is important that other Members of your Household also do not reveal their passwords to anyone else. In the event of any breach of security, which may include unauthorized access or use of your Household Account, immediately notify DECE at admin@decellc.com. DECE shall not be responsible for any losses incurred as a result of unauthorized access to or use of your Household Account. Termination and Suspension of a Member or Household If for any reason you no longer wish to participate in UltraViolet, you may delete yourself as a Member of a Household account at any time by navigating to the "Household Settings" link, and following instructions to delete individual accounts or the entire Household Account. Your cancellation will be effective immediately. If you wish to retain the UltraViolet Digital Content obtained by you prior to termination, you must download the content to an UltraViolet Device or save the content to a form of discrete media, such as a DVD, prior to termination in each case, only as authorized by DECE and in accordance with DECE?requirements. You agree that DECE may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to you, restrict, suspend, or terminate your access to part or all of UltraViolet if DECE believes you or a Member of your Household is using or has used UltraViolet in violation of the UltraViolet Terms of Use or applicable law or in any manner other than for its intended purpose and in accordance with all other guidelines and requirements applicable thereto. Without limiting the foregoing, DECE may restrict or suspend your access to your Household Account upon reasonable notice to you, which may be communicated electronically, for cause, which includes but is not limited to (i) requests from law enforcement or other government agencies, (ii) unexpected technical issues or problems; or (iii) if DECE reasonably believes that your Household has been created fraudulently, your Household has been accessed fraudulently, or a Member of your Household has otherwise committed fraud or is using your Household Account other than for its intended purpose and in accordance with all of the requirements applicable thereto. In addition, you understand that DECE may modify or cease providing UltraViolet or the UltraViolet Website or any portion of UltraViolet or the UltraViolet Website at any time without notice. You agree that DECE will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such restriction, suspension, or termination of your access to your Household Account or any UltraViolet Digital Content. ON TERMINATION OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNT, WHETHER TERMINATED BY YOU OR BY DECE, YOU WILL LOSE ALL ACCESS TO THE ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL CONTENT IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE (A) DOWNLOADED THE ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL CONTENT TO AN ULTRAVIOLET DEVICE, OR (B) SAVED THE ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL CONTENT TO A FORM OF DISCRETE MEDIA, SUCH AS A DVD, IN EACH CASE, ONLY AS AUTHORIZED BY DECE AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH DECE?REQUIREMENTS. DECE Access To Your Account In connection with the operation of UltraViolet, DECE and/or its contractors will have administrative access to your Household Account to provide customer service, maintenance and support, investigate complaints, and/or fix errors.
