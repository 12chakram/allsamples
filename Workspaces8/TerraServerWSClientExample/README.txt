* Description

TerraServerWSClientExample is an example web application that demonstrates
interfacing with the Microsoft TerraServer imaging web services. A user submits 
a postal address through a web form and the application converts it to a 
longtitude and latitude coordinate pair using the getTileMetaFromLonLatPt web service.

This project demonstrates interfacing with a public web service.  To simplify 
operation this project is preconfigured to run with the 1-Click application launcher 
on the MyEclipse Server Sandbox,  i.e., embedded Tomcat 6 servlet container that 
ships with MyEclipse 6.
 
The project architecture consists of:

   1. A  JSP UI form for collecting the user's address details and then displaying the resulting long-lat coordinate
   2. The web service client API is autogenerated using the MyEclipse 6 web services client wizard
   3. All  web service invocation and result processing is performed within the main jsp page

 
* Requirements

	* MyEclipse 6.0 or later
	* Java SE 5 or greater

* How to Run

Right-click on this project and select either Debug As or Run As. Then select
"MyEclipse Server Application". MyEclipse 6  will automatically deploy
the application to the MyEclipse Tomcat Server, then start it up and open
a browser window for you to the index.jsp page.
