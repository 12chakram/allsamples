* Description

This is a very simple one-page JSP application that demonstrates  how to 
calculate the absolute URL and relative context path for a JSP page.
Additionally, the JSP page contains both embedded and external Java calls that 
you can use to set breakpoints to try out the MyEclipse JSP and Java debugging 
facilities.

* Requirements

	* MyEclipse 6.0 or a previous version of MyEclipse with an application
	server that the project can be deployed to and run.

* How to Run

This example can be executed within MyEclipse 6.0+ by using the one-click 
application launcher by right-clicking on the project in the Package Explorer 
view and then selecting:

"Debug As..." > "MyEclipse Server Application"

This will execute the example on the embedded MyEclipse
Tomcat 6 server.
