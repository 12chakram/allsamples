MyEclipse Google Maps Example Project

* License

This project is provided under the Apache 2 license, please see LICENSE.txt for
details.

* Description

This is a simple example application that uses the Google Maps JavaScript API.
This example application uses an embedded Google Map widget on the page to
display the location (and longitude and latitude) of the address typed in by
the user.

It is possible to set breakpoints inside the /resources/map.js file and watch
how the Google JavaScript APIs work by stepping into them and inspecting their
runtime values using the advanced JavaScript tooling in MyEclipse.

* Requirements

	* MyEclipse 6.0 or a previous version of MyEclipse with an application
	server that the project can be deployed to and run.
	* MyEclipse 6.0 provides enhanced JavaScript tooling that wasn't available
	in previous versions, but the project should still run with previous
	versions of MyEclipse.

* How to Run

The easiest way to Run this project (Because it's JavaScript based, and runs
inside the browser) is to simply open the JSP page in the MyEclipse Visual JSP
Designer, and switch to the Preview tab.

Alternatively you can deploy the project to the MyEclipse Tomcat 6 Server and
then run it using the URL http://localhost:8080/GoogleMapsExample

NOTE: If you have changed the default Tomcat port from 8080 to something else, be sure to
change the URL to the correct port.
